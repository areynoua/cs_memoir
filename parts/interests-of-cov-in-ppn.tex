As it provides evidence of safety properties on the studied systems, the coverability problem is of primary interest in system design and verification. Therefore, for the reasons given in the previous \namecref{sec:interests-of-ppn}, it is worth being able to solve it efficiently on \acp{PPN}.

\label{label:mutex-example}
To give a more concrete intuition on the interest, consider a system that execute a \emph{task} for others systems.
At each instant (whatever an instant is), the system may receive requests to perform the task from many other systems. We say that each request creates a \emph{job}.
We would like to have a system that is not too expensive to implement, but also capable of completing the tasks quickly enough.
To this end, we make our system capable of performing $a$ jobs at the same time. %, keeping $a$ as low as possible to reduce costs.
This system may be modelled as shown on the figure~\ref{fig:parametric-petri-net-example} with $\mari = (0, \param[1], 0)$ as initial marking.
$p_1$ represents the job queue and $p_3$ the execution unit.

In the end of \Cref{label:mutex-example-analyse}, we will see how the analyse of the \ac{PN} ensure that the above mentioned property holds.
