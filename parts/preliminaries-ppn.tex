By reduction from the halting problem as well as the counter boundedness problem, \cite{David17} has shown that \Ucov and \Ecov are undecidable on \ac{PPN}.
This motivates the introduction of two natural subclasses of \acp{PPN} where parametric coverability problems are decidable.

Namely,
PreT-PPNs are \acp{PPN} where parameters are used only in $\matI$;
PostT-PPNs are \acp{PPN} where parameters are used only in $\matO$.
\cite{David17} provides an adaptation of the Karp and Miller Algorithm to solve the \Ucov problem on PreT-\acp{PPN}, and another to solve the \Ecov problem on PostT-\acp{PPN}.
