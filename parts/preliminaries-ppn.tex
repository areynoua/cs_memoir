\cite{David17} as shown that \Ucov and \Ecov are undecidable on \ac{PPN} and define natural subclasses of \acp{PPN} are defined in which parametric coberability problems are decidable.

PreT-PPNs are \acp{PPN} where parameters are used only in $\matI$.
PostT-PPNs are \acp{PPN} where parameters are used only in $\matO$.

\cite{David17} provides an adaptation of the Karp and Miller Algorithm to solve the \Ucov problem on PreT-\acp{PPN}, and another to solve the \Ecov problem on PostT-\acp{PPN}.
