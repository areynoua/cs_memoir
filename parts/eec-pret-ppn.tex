In this section we provide an adaption of \ac{EEC} to work with \acp{PPN}.
It is inspired by the \todo{KM\textsuperscript{+}} algorithm from \cite{David17}.

The algorithm is the same as the one presented in the section~\ref{sec:eec}, with the difference that the condition to add a marking to the over-approximation is more restrictive.
