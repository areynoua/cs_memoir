This chapter intends to introduce known results on both \ac{PN} and \ac{PPN}.
They are not extensively described here:
since they are mentioned only as far as they can help the presentation of the results in the next chapter, the intuition is often given without any detail nor proof.
The reader is therefore encouraged to refer to the mentioned sources.
