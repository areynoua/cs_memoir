There are numerous examples of practical uses of \acp{PN}.

To name a few,
\cite{Murata89} provides a convenient yet formal presentation of analysis techniques of \ac{PN} and examples of applications for performance modelling.
It is a good first approach of this model.

To have an example of specific use, let us mention
\cite{koci2016modeling} which uses \acp{PN} alongside with \emph{use case diagrams} from \ac{UML} as a unique formal model for requirement specification, verification, and implementation.
