There are numerous examples of practical uses of \acp{PN}.

To name a few,
\cite{Marsan94} use \acp{PN}, as well as several generalisation of the model, for many modelling purpose.
For example, timed \acp{PN} are used for performance control.

\cite{valk1985residue} use \acp{PN} to solve Dijkstra's \emph{banker's problem}.

To have an example of specific use, let us mention
\cite{koci2016modeling} which uses \acp{PN} alongside with \emph{use case diagrams} from \ac{UML} as a unique formal model for requirement specification, verification, and implementation.

We reference also
\cite{Murata89} that provides a convenient yet formal presentation of analysis techniques of \ac{PN} and examples of applications for performance modelling.
It is a good first approach of this model.
